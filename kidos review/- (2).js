// user flow -> did test casing
  // - profile info and edit settings are to be done on the same page
  // - once you are logged in you should not have to enter every time your chatname
  // - should be able to add your own category?
  // - once you have searched for an offer it is hard to go back to see all ofers again unless refresh
  // - reviewing a person is nice, but one should only be able do that if they have an interrelation
    // - updating a foto then is not needed

// information architecture:
  // -  put everything in two folders - back and front end

// put in read.me
  // - two weak sprint
  // - what you have accomplished 
  // - and what still needs to be built
