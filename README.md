# Time 4 Time

#### MERN stack

Final project at Ironhack's full-stack web development bootcamp.

In our project, you can share time with other people and accumulate time for some fun activities. No money involved, just time!

For example, Manouk can repair bikes, so she posts an offer to teach someone how to do it in 2 hours. Luis is new to Amsterdam and he needs to improve his knowledge about bicycles, so he applies to Manouk's offer and waits for her approval. He can do so because he got 2 hours to spend when he signed up, so he can get started in the platform. When Manouk approves his petition, she will gain 2 hours and he will pay the same amount, both user's "time wallets" being updated.
