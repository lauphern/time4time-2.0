      "With time! We believe our society is too focused on money, we want to get back the sense of community and sharing with each other. So, let's say you want to learn how to sing. You go on our website and find someone that offers singing classes. Every class lasts one hour, so that's what you pay, 1 hour! If you offer any activity, you will get paid in hours too. All this time is stored in your Time Wallet â€“when you sign up, we give you two hours for free so you can try some activities :)",
